- there is a new command for boonas, it is like the polygon command but the first 3 points are taken as rgb color values

# boonas polygonC <outfile> <r> <g> <b> . . .. .

-boonas command for rotation on an arbitrary axis is as follows

# boonas rot <infile> <outfile> <vectx> <vecty> <vectz> <x> <y> <z> <number of duplications> <amount to rotate in degrees>

-boonas command for clipping is as follows, the in polygons are

# boonas clip <infile> <outfile> <vectx> <vecty> <vectz> <x> <y> <z>

-the viewer command has changed, it now always starts you looking towards positive z from whatever point  you pass it
the command is now called thus

# viewer <full name of file to view> <camera x> <camera y> <camera z>

you can then use the mouse to interact with the program. clicking engages mouse tracking so you can look around with the
mouse, right click to speed up, left click to slow down, middle click to disengage mouse tracking and stop the speed.
you can use middle click to look around from a stagnant position. 

############# to compile and test #################

to compile cd into boonas, use qmake and make to make boonas copy boonas into the test directory
do the same except for viewer with the viewer directory.
	
cd into the test directory and check out the example shell scripts

clip.sh an example of clip

rot.sh an example of rotation around an arbitrary axis

I used crazy colors in them so that differnt things could be discerned, since there was no shading or texstures things blurred together if they were the same color.
